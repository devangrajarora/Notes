# Intro to ML
Machine Learning is the process of trainging a software (i.e. a **model**) on **data** to make _meaningful predictions_ and _generate new content_.
* Make meaningful predictions:
	* Translate a sentence to a different language
	* Suggest next songs in a playlist
	* Predict the weather over the next 10 days
* Generate new content:
  * Text to image/video etc
  * Summarize a text
  * Write story based on prompt

How to use ML to predict weather data?
1. Provide the ML model on a large amount of weather data
2. Model _learns_ the relationship between weather patterns and amount of rain produced
3. Model can _predict_ the amount of rain produced for given weather conditions

**Model**: A model is a mathematical relationship derived from data which an ML system uses to make predictions.

## Types of ML systems
Based on techniques used for prediction and content generation:
1. Supervised learning
2. Unsupervised learning
3. Reinforcement learning
4. Generative AI

### Supervised Learning
* The model is provided with a large amount of data with correct answers
* Models learns to associate elements with data to correct answers. With these correlations and patterns, the model predicts answers of future problems
* Examples
	* Similar to a student studying old exam papers with answers to prepare for new questions.
  * Looking are previous quarter returns to predict next quarter returns
